The error message: SyntaxError: syntax error, unexpected ')', expecting '}' tells us that we mistakenly used a closing parenthesis instead of a closing curley bracket for a block somewhere, most likely at the end of a method definition or method call. It may also include a line number and file name somewhere in the error message to tell us exactly  where it happened. Most IDE's can probably help find it as well.
