=begin
This program creates an error because it is missing the & symbol for the method parameter that is a block. The & character tells Ruby that that parameter is a block so that it can convert the block into a Proc object, so that it can be given a name and be passed as a parameter to other methods. The error shown says that it is an incorrect number of arguments, because the method call on line 5 is incorrect according to the current method definition. The method call is passing a block, but the method definition has no way of accepting a block as an argument. And it also thinks that it needs to be passed a normal variable argument instead, which the method call does not provide any.

So line 1 should read:
def execute(&block)
=end
